Growing up in Stuttgart, Germany - the early hotbed of German Hip-Hop
- I first experimented with DJ'ing at age of 14.

My palate for music stretches across various genres including
Hip-Hop, Trip-Hop, Reggae, Dubstep and Swing . With a penchant
for punchy beats and groovy sounds, my sets are blends of different
genres with lots of suprising turns and uplifting remixes. 

The sets are seldomly carved into stone before the performance and I
like to swish through various parts and sense the pulse of the
audience and interact with the crowd.

Apart from performing live, I also compose my own remixes with live
recording on Traktor S2. 

Here are some of my own remixes and sets:

---

## [Birthday Of The Octopus](https://soundcloud.com/tolgascloud/birthday-of-the-octopus)

Commemorating his 30th birthday, good old friend Richard Edaem threw his
party of his series "Octopus Garden" at the Sultan Jazz Club, Singapore.
I came up with the remix for this event itself. Using "Nas is like"
acapella as the main vocal, it has uplifting beats and rythmic elements
from Alific's Dub version of "99 Problems", Max Romeo's "Chase The
Devil", Chinese Man's "Jumpin' in Havana".

On this remix set, we have Kid Koala with Che Guevara UN convention
speech, Grammatik with "Changes" acapella, Leygo's Shadow DJ,
Cypress Hill Klezmer Band & Chicha remix, Captain Cumbia's Mash-Up
with Beastie Boys, Cuban Vibes with Chinese Man, all finally rounded
up with fine Somalian Hip Hop a la Knaan. Buen apetito!

In this remix set, I experimented with a bold mash of orchestral soundtrack music
from "The Fountain", vocals and acapella from "No Diggity" and "Shook
Ones", and latin influence using "Chan Chan" bass and "Viene De Mi".

## [Viene De Encore](https://soundcloud.com/tolgascloud/viene-de-encore-dj-sinar-hayat)

This is my first recorded remix using Traktor S2. Using my favorite tunes
"Encore" and "Viene De Mi" with beat from Omega One's "Memento", I
gave it a go. Live recording on Traktor S2.
