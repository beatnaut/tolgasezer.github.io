Harry Markowitz, the pioneer of modern portfolio theory (MPT), introduced
his theory in an article in 1952. Ironically, he had classified the
theory simply as *portfolio theory* because: "*There was nothing
modern about it* ", he thought.

As influential and important as the theory has been for theoretical as
well as applied finance, the shortcomings introduced by the basic
assumptions have been increasingly challenged in recent years. 

At its core, the MPT makes many assumptions about investors and
markets which does not match the real world in many ways. 

Investors are interested in the optimization problem described above
(maximizing the mean for a given variance). In reality, investors have
utility functions that may be sensitive to higher moments of the
distribution of the returns. For the investors to use the
mean-variance optimization, one must suppose that the combination
of utility and returns make the optimization of utility problem
similar to the mean-variance optimization problem. A quadratic utility
without any assumption about returns is sufficient. Another assumption
is to use exponential utility and normal distribution, asdiscussed below.
